## Simply Todo List

Rethinking of [a small app on Django](https://github.com/tvey/simply-todo-list) using pure Javascript and LocalStorage.

The app allows to add, edit, delete, copy and sort (on desktop) items.

Works on Netlify: [https://simply-todo-list.netlify.app/](https://simply-todo-list.netlify.app/)

## Tiny Flask

Dockerized web app with Nginx. Build images locally with Nginx listening on port 8000

```bash
bash run-compose.sh
```

or compose with premade images and with Nginx on port 80

```bash
bash run-prod-compose.sh
```
